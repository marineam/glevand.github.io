Public Domain Icons

These icons were originally made for Mosaic for X and have been included in the
NCSA httpd and Apache server distributions in the past. They are in the public
domain and may be freely included in any application. The originals were done by
Kevin Hughes (kevinh@kevcom.com). Andy Polyakov tuned the icon colors and added
few new images.
